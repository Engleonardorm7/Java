# Fixies and Pixies
Java program

> Rules of the game

The player must guess a 4-digit secret number, with no repeated digits.
If the player guess a correct digit in the correct position, it is called "Fixies," while if the player match a digit but in the wrong position, it is called "Pixies."

For example, if your opponent's secret number is "1854" and you guess "4879," the feedback you will receive is: 1 Fixie and 1 Pixie ("8" is the Fixie , and "4" is the Pixie).

The first person to reveal the secret number wins the game.
